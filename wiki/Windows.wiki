#summary Running the framework in Windows

= Introduction =

To run the poker framework on Windows, you'll need Python.  If you want to use C++ or Java for your bot, follow the instructions for those languages as well.  For C++ and Java, the Python framework uses Google's [http://code.google.com/p/protobuf/ Protocol Buffers] to communicate over stdin and stdout with your bot.
